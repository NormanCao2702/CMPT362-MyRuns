# CMPT362-MyRuns
## Short Description
This is a 3-month assignment to build a comprehensive app called `MyRuns` to track user location and speed when they are doing exercise, automatically detect what exercise are they training including Run, Walk, Climb, unknown; based on the **phone's accelerometer** (e.g how intense does user shake the phone?). All user's running history will be stored locally through `Room Database`. Additionally, there are some small adds-on feature from the app such as switching **distance preferences**(kilometer or miles), **take/upload photos**.
